# Mightnight-Kanagawa

A round-cornered theme based on refact0r's midnight theme!
Best used alongside the Kanagawa GTK theme on Linux.

Midnight fixes the connected top toolbar problem that other rounded themes like https://github.com/PlusInsta/discord-plus have.

# classic

I haven't made a classic theme like the original Midnight theme yet, if enough people want it, I'll make it. But as of I have no plans to do so.
Let me know If you'd like to see a classic version of this theme!
